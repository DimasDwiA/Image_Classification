# Image_Classification
## Introduction
In this project, I made machine learning to classify images from the rock-paper-scissors game, as we all know the rock-paper-scissors game is a very easy game to play, usually the rock-paper-scissors game is played before the main game. The dataset used contains images of hand movements from the rock-paper-scissors game. Image was taken as part of a hobby project where I developed a rock-paper-scissors game using computer vision and machine learning
